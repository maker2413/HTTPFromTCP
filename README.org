#+TITLE: HTTP From TCP

This is just a simple program that builds out an HTTP server from scratch.

This program was created while following along with the course on [[https://www.boot.dev/u/maker2413][Boot.dev]].

To run the HTTP server you can do the following:
#+begin_src shell
  go run .
#+end_src
